x (A) kevan: if there is a way, implement a reccomendation system to recommend art based on the art that a user already saves and likes
x (A) fix the emoji code, now a sepearte box is being rendered and emojis can only be dragged there, i want images to be dragged onto the image itself
x (A) move the emoji bar beneath the image instead so the emoji bar is beneath teh image, the comments section is on the right of the image
x (A) pin the currently selected emoji to the cursor when its being dragged to the image, so clicking an emoji attaches it to the user's mouse and only when the user clicks again does it detach and land on the image

x (A) add functionality so that when i clcik an image within saved posts, it brings up the same zoomed in view with the emoji panel as when i clcik an image from the dashboard directly
x (A) now make it so that when users press and hold an image (in the dashbaord overview), they can freely change its position and an image is pinned to its new location when users let go
x (A) actually add functionality for page scrolling so that scrolling the mouse results in the user flipping the page of the sketchbook on dashboard/page.tsx
x (A) link all the frontend features to a proper backend
x (A) deprecate the current version of modo and focus on getting the frontend features to be where i want them to be first, completely remove authentciation and just simulate logging in with a provided username and password
x (A) after the frontend and all features are up, then add a backend with proper firebase data being sent and stored and actual authentication, but handle that later
x (A) try and get a firebase up and running and link it to see if it works
x (A) debug any next.js errors that popup and DONT GIVE UP, treat modo as a good learning experience to properly fully deploy a web app for the first time including database integration
x (A) beautify the frontend further and make it unique, minimalist and interesting

x (A) nichole: ability to save other people's posts as jpegs, jpg, webp, png and whatever other common formats are used
x (A) kevan: implement a hashtag system, implement a detailed art-specific hashtag system (ask GPT for common art themes like watercolor, bnw, clay etc) and allow people to easily find your posts 

(A) continue conversation with v0 from modo social media app v42 to implement the following features
